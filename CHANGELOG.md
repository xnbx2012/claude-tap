### Changed
- feat!: omit raw stream events by default (#231)
### Changed
- **Breaking change:** raw SSE and WebSocket stream event arrays are no longer persisted by default. Pass `--tap-store-stream-events` when capturing a trace to store those raw event arrays in trace storage and viewer/export output; traces captured without the flag cannot recover the omitted raw events later.

### Changed
- fix(codex): capture custom provider base URLs (#228)
### Fixed
- Capture Codex custom OpenAI-compatible providers by overriding the selected provider base URL, not only `openai_base_url`.

### Changed
- **Breaking change:** the live viewer now starts by default when `claude-tap` runs a client, so users can watch trace records while the agent is still running (#192).
